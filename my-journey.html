            <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                I graduated in <strong>2019 from Christ University, Bangalore</strong>, and soon found myself wanderingâ€”backpacking, volunteering across Himachal, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, and Goa. I worked at farms, homestays, hostels, eco-retreatsâ€”absorbing different cultures, learning new skills, and experiencing life in its rawest form.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                But one experience stood out. During the <strong>monsoon of 2019, I volunteered at Varanashi Organic Farms</strong> near Mangalore. It was my first real exposure to farming. I worked alongside farmers, ate clean, organic food, and embraced the rhythm of the land.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                By the end of my time there, something had changed. My body felt lighter, healthier, and deeply connected to nature. 
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                When the pandemic shut everything down, my travels came to an abrupt halt. I returned home and joined the <strong>family business</strong>, but I felt no soulfulness in itâ€”something was missing. Seeking an escape, I attempted <strong>CFA</strong>, but <strong>failure in the exam</strong> threw me into a deep period of uncertainty and chaos.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Thatâ€™s when I turned to <strong>wellnessâ€”not as a business idea, but as a personal necessity.</strong> I became obsessed with <strong>sourcing the finest herbs, the purest oils, and the most authentic ingredients for myself.</strong> I started experimentingâ€”my <strong>bathroom became a mini-lab.</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                As my knowledge grew, I wanted to turn it into something tangible. I began sourcing <strong>organic Amla & Moringa, processing them into powders, and designing branding.</strong> But as I got deeper into it, I realized <strong>the market was flooded</strong> with similar products.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                I pivoted towards <strong>natural cosmetics & Ayurvedic oils</strong>â€”creating <strong>face masques, herbal body cleansers, hair oils, and nasya oils.</strong> The products were excellent, but I hit an unexpected roadblock. 
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Government regulations for commercial production required:
            </p>
            <ul class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside">
                <li>âœ… Processing facilities in an industrial area.</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The process would consume all my time and resources, turning me into a factory operator instead of a creator.

                I was already producing almond oil for my <strong>herbal formulations.</strong> I had a <strong>trusted sourcing network in Kashmir</strong>, my own small-scale processing setup, and a deep understanding of purity.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Instead of dividing my energy across multiple products, I decided to <strong>focus entirely on crafting the purest almond oil.</strong>
