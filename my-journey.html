        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            My journey started in 2019 when I volunteered at <strong>Varanashi Organic Farms</strong>, near Mangalore, Karnataka. 
            I spent my days working alongside farmers, understanding the essence of organic agriculture, and experiencing firsthand how nature and wellness are deeply intertwined.
            Little did I know, this experience would plant the seed for what I do today.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            After my travels, I found myself exploring the world of <strong>wellness</strong> more deeply. 
            My bathroom shelf was soon filled with herbs, powders, and oils as I experimented with self-care formulations.
            I became obsessed with sourcing the finest herbs and understanding their properties—an obsession that naturally led me back to the farmers.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">From Experimentation to Creation</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I started <strong>small-batch processing</strong> of herbs like Amla and Moringa in my home setup. 
            Drying, grinding, and packaging them into pure wellness products—it was an exciting phase.
            But soon, I realized that creating a truly unique and meaningful brand required focus and refinement.

    <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto my-16 px-6">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">A Shift in Focus</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            As I ventured into <strong>natural cosmetics and Ayurvedic oils</strong>, I discovered that regulatory challenges made large-scale production difficult.
            But I also found clarity—what if I dedicated myself fully to <strong>one product, perfected to its finest form?</strong>
            That's when I turned my attention to <strong>almond oil</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I set up my own <strong>small-scale processing unit</strong> at home, ensuring purity, hygiene, and a handcrafted touch.
            Every step, from sourcing almonds in Kashmir to pressing the oil, became a process I deeply enjoy.
            <strong>Kasar Devi Almond Oil</strong> was born—not just as a product, but as a philosophy of purity and craftsmanship.
