        <p>Back in 2019, fresh out of college, I had no plans set in stone. I started backpacking across Himachal, Uttarakhand, Goa, and Karnataka, taking up volunteering gigs in homestays, hostels, and eco-retreats. Then came my first real encounter with farming—at Varanashi Organic Farms in Karnataka.</p>

        <p>The days were raw—sweating under the sun, working alongside farmers, eating fresh organic food straight from the land. By the time my volunteering ended, I felt a change—physically, mentally, and emotionally. Looking back, I didn’t realize then how deeply that experience would shape my future.</p>

        <p>Then COVID happened, and everything paused. My travel stopped. I found myself back home, involved in the family business—something that never quite felt like me. I attempted CFA as a way out, but when that didn’t work, I spiraled into uncertainty. That’s when I turned towards wellness, not as a business but as a way to heal myself.</p>

        <p>Wellness became an obsession. The perfectionist in me wanted the **best** herbs, the **purest** ingredients. My curiosity led me back to farmers, sourcing directly from the land, just like I had done at Varanashi. That’s when something clicked.</p>

        <p>From there, I started experimenting—sourcing organic **Amla & Moringa**, processing them at home, branding them into high-quality wellness products. But the market was flooded with similar things. I shifted towards **natural cosmetics** and **Ayurvedic oils**—developing formulations for face masques, herbal cleansers, hair oils. But then, reality hit. Manufacturing cosmetics required extensive licenses, industrial setups, and a team of Ayurvedic doctors—something I wasn’t ready to compromise my freedom for.</p>

        <p>Then came Almond Oil. I was already making it as an ingredient for my oils. I had trusted sourcing in Kashmir, and my processing setup was in place. It made sense to dedicate myself fully to this. I moved my setup to my home’s drawing room to ensure **absolute quality control and a homemade essence.** Now, this is what I do—every single step, from sourcing to crafting, is something I enjoy deeply.</p>

        <p>Kasar Devi Almond Oil isn’t just a business—it’s a process, a journey, and a pursuit of purity.</p>
